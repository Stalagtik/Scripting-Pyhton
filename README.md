Explore the usage of the `subprocess` module for both Windows and Linux environments. The exercise involves pinging machines on the network using `subprocess`.

## Exercise 3: Socket (exercice3.py)

This exercise introduces the `socket` module, offering diverse options to ping machines on the network. Additionally, it allows you to check open ports on a chosen network.

## Exercise 4: Scapy (exercice4.py)

Utilize the Scapy library to identify unique IP addresses and create a pcap file with relevant information.

## Exercise 4 (with Threads): Scapy with Threading (exercice4thread.py)

Similar to the Scapy exercise, this version implements thread for increased speed and efficiency.

## Exercise 4 (with Multiprocessing): Scapy with Multiprocessing (exercice4multiprocessing.py)

Similar to the Scapy exercise, this version implements multiprocessing for increased speed and efficiency.
